GreenCred – Democratizing Access to the Carbon Economy

“GreenCred” is a climate-tech platform that enables smallholder farmers and landowners to generate, verify, and monetize “carbon credits” through regenerative land practices. Using AI-powered remote sensing, automated MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) systems, and a built-in marketplace, GreenCred connects these rural stakeholders directly to corporates seeking carbon offsets, unlocking a new revenue stream while accelerating the transition to net zero.

> Bridging the gap between rural sustainability and industrial decarbonization.

## Problem

Despite millions of farmers worldwide adopting climate-positive practices like agroforestry, no-till farming, and cover cropping:

- They lack access to carbon credit markets
- Traditional MRV and certification is expensive and complex
- There is no direct platform to sell verified credits to corporates

### Our Solution

GreenCred offers a full-stack platform for:

- Farmer onboarding with KYC, geotagging, and practice documentation
- Automated carbon tracking using AI + satellite data (NDVI, EVI, biomass models)
- CO₂ sequestration estimation based on land use and historical data
- Credit aggregation and sale through a transparent B2B marketplace
- Optional tokenization of credits for auditability and liquidity

##  Mission

> To make carbon finance accessible, transparent, and profitable for every farmer, while helping industries meet their climate goals with high-integrity offsets.
